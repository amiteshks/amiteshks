### 🚀 Engineering Leader | Generative AI Practitioner | SaaS Innovator

I’m a **hands-on AI engineering leader** passionate about building production-grade **Generative AI applications and platforms**.  
My work spans developing **AI Copilots across HR Tech, Payroll Tech, FinTech, and Accounting Tech**, leveraging **LLMs (both local and third-party)**, **moderation APIs**, **fine-tuning pipelines**, and **vector-based retrieval with Milvus and FAISS**.  
I specialize in **end-to-end orchestration** using **LangChain**, **LangGraph**, and **FastAPI**, with **evaluation and observability** powered by **RAGAS** and **LangSmith**.  
With a strong foundation in **distributed systems**, **SaaS platform engineering**, and **cloud-native architecture (AWS, Docker, Kubernetes)**, I focus on transforming traditional enterprise workflows into **intelligent, context-aware, and data-driven experiences**.  
I’m driven by bridging the gap between **AI research and real-world deployment**, enabling teams to build **trustworthy, scalable, and measurable GenAI solutions**.
